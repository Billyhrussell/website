    </header>
    <p>I graduated from San Jose State University May 2021
      in Sociology with an emphasis in Human Interaction. Throughout my
      studies, my favorite part was learning quantitative analysis,
      gathering and analyzing data in order to form conclusions or get an
      idea of why things would happen. After graduating I started a job in
      QA data analysis and through working with certain softwares, I realized
      I wanted more, to do more and to be able to make softwares better,
      easier, simpler and more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending a lot of time thinking about my future, I believe that
      working on problems and creating solutions is something that I want to
      do as a career. I had taken a C++ class in undergrad and I remember
      really enjoying the troubleshooting and satisfaction once the code
      worked. This is what led me to make a career change into software
      engineering. I am currently enrolled at Rithm School as part of their
      2022 cohort, starting in May and will continue to update this website
      with my future projects.
